--I'm answering questions about customer/sales data for an electronics store.

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS number_of_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS number_of_iphone_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND product = "iPhone";

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6;

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and whay was the price
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price = (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, round(SUM(quantity*price),2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product <> '' AND product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
